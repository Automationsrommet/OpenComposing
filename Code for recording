So I have an idea to start this off. Three step recording with the following rules.

Step one is for the song carperntry. Riffs are put together, lyrics are adjusted as needed, one could even trade ideas betweeen songs if need be.
Copy and paste are allowed and instruments can be added and removed at will. Metronome is allowed and probably useful.
The goal in step one is having the song anatomy complete with length, order and everything mapped out. Then step two can begin.

Step two is recording as best I can at home with all the limitations that means. I think a drum track should be laid down first. Then bass and keys or whatever comes next. Vocals too
Metronome should not be allowed, so that struggeling with recording whole songs means good instrumental practice. Taking my time on this step makes sense.
Focusing on the musical rather than the technical side of things would help the songs find their identity and character, I hope. 
That is the goal in step two, along with learning the different songs and voices thoroghly, as that is needed in step three.

Step three then is going to an actual recording studio and renting proffesional help there, hopefully well enough prepared that one stands a chance of completing all recordings in the cource of two weeks, or whatever timeframe I can afford.
Having the recording technician, or producer on board in evaluating step one and two seems quite valuable as neccesary adjustments then could be done at a lower level. When the producer knows the songs from an early age, he or she will work in accord with the musician and provide efficient synergy.
After completing all steps I would rent the rest of the services reqired to press 12 inch vinyl records, unless there exists an open source vinyl press project that one can build and operate without owning a fortune.
