The consept phase is where the sets of ideas for songs, sounds and meaning gets chewed into place. I've only released songs once, but then I realize that it was five times. Those four mini-cds should have been all recorded and published within the frame of a month in the calender back in 07 and 08, and all four of them should have fitted inside the frame of a year, meaning that the last one should have come out in april 08 to seal of the year, as may 07 was the beginning. This failed and december 08 was finished with little hope of hitting the nail. The two in the middle, though, Lodas and Bogat, I quite like.
The fifth time was when my brother convinced med that those same hasty recordings were worth working on and he reworked and remastered them and helped me order pressing 150 12 inch black vinyls in Nedherlands. Most of them are still upstairs waiting for my very unique machine sown upcycled plastic covers.
  Now that the physical vinyl 12 inch record is established as the ideal end-goal format, this is integrated in the earliest stages of idea chewing.

  So I was on my thursday walk and passed a tree that had fallen and uprooted one side. The other side, however, was still in the ground and the tree had continued growing for a couple of years sideways with multiple sprouts vertical from the now horisontal trunk. This is to be the next album name, message, essence and cover art, i thought and photographed it with my phone.
  I've done some reading lately that I hope to integrate into the work:
Walden by Henry David Thoreau
The essential Margaret Fuller
Nature by Ralph Waldo Emerson
Isiah
Jeremiah
