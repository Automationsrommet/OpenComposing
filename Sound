So the last time around the sound was a key based one man band with occational flute leaning hevily on the reed organ. Hevily limited by my instrumental and recording skills. Also limiting was the time window I had set aside for the recordings.

This time I hope to introduce more variation. I also aquired a new instrument: Philichord stage organ from my late grandparents' house, it holds tons of nostalgia for me. 
Being open source and all, I have an idea for a synthesizer based on rp2040 with additive synthesis and waveforms using PIO and statemachines. Might emerge here on Github in 2024. That should be able to add som novalty to the sound of this album as it could showcase the instrument to some extent.
I feel i used up the reed organ already, but it probably has a place in the mix still. Perhaps even with flanger.
As for instrumentalist skills, I hope to be a bit more open this time to include other hands.
Recording-wise I plan to let my brother handle all of that stuff since he knowes what he is doing. And time should not be limited in the same way as before. But economy sort of is. So I figure the solution could be recording everything fast and fuzzy at home with all the time in the world. Then bring it to the time limited studio situation well rehearsed.
